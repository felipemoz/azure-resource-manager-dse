# azure-resource-manager-dse

These are Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates for deploying DataStax Enterprise (DSE).  These have been modified specifically to work with the Azure German cloud.  If you don't have a desire to deploy to the German Cloud, you'll likely be happier with [master](https://github.com/DSPN/azure-resource-manager-dse), the public cloud branch of this.
